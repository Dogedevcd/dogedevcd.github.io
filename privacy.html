<strong>Privacy Policy</strong>

Effective Date: 2025-02-25

This Privacy Policy applies to the My Bit Pet app, provided by Dogedev as an Ad Supported service. By using this app, you agree to the collection and use of your information as described in this policy.

<strong>Information Collection and Use</strong>

I may require you to provide personally identifiable information for a better experience, which will be retained on your device and not collected by me. Third-party services used by the app may collect information to identify you.

<strong>Third-party Service Providers</strong>

Google Play Services and other third-party companies may collect information to improve their services or assist in analyzing how our Service is used. They may have access to your Personal Information but are obligated not to disclose or use it for other purposes.

<strong>Log Data</strong>

When you use the app, I collect Log Data through third-party products, including your device's IP address, name, operating system version, app configuration, usage statistics, and more.

<strong>Cookies</strong>

This Service does not use cookies explicitly, but third-party code and libraries may use them. You can choose to accept or refuse cookies, but refusing may limit your use of some parts of the Service.

<strong>Security</strong>

While I strive to protect your Personal Information using commercially acceptable means, I cannot guarantee absolute security due to the nature of internet transmission and electronic storage.

<strong>Links to Other Sites</strong>

This Service may contain links to external sites not operated by me. I advise reviewing the Privacy Policy of those sites, as I have no control over their content or practices.

<strong>Childrenâ€™s Privacy</strong>

My Service does not address anyone under 13 years old, and I do not knowingly collect personal information from children under 13. If such information is discovered, it will be promptly deleted.

<strong>Changes to This Privacy Policy</strong>

I may update this Privacy Policy, and any changes will be posted on this page. It's advised to review this policy periodically for updates.
